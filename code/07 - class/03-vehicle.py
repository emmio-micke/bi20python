"""
x Create a class named Vehicle, use the __init__() function to assign values for make, model, color, year, velocity and no_of_wheels.
x Velocity should always be set to 0.
x Let no_of_wheels be optional when creating an object by setting the default value 4 for the appropriate __init__() parameter.
x Create a couple of vehicles and print out their properties.

x Add the max_speed property to the Vehicle class.
x Create the methods accelerate() and decelerate() that both take a change parameter and increases / decreases the velocity.
x Check the parameter. The new speed canâ€™t be lower than 0 or higher than the max speed.
x Create a class named Car and let it inherit from Vehicle. The max_speed should always be 160.
x Create a class named Truck and let it inherit from Vehicle.
x The max_speed should always be 80.
x Add the property load_capacity.
x Create a couple of cars and trucks and print out their properties.
x Create the method print() that prints out the properties for the vehicle.
Create the class Motorcycle that inherits from Vehicle. Max speed is 200.
